# Divide and conquer
The **divide and conquer paradigm** /ˈpær.ə.daɪm/ involves **three** steps **at each level of recursion**:
1. **Divide**: the **problem** is divided into a number **subproblems** that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2. **Conquer**: every subproblem is solved.
3. **Combine**: the solutions are combined into the resulting solution of the original problem.

The *divide* stage is performed **recursively**, then *conquer* and *combine* stages **gather results** of **every** recursion level back **together**.
