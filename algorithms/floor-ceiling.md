# Floor and ceiling functions

The **floor function**, is the function that takes as *input* a *real number* `x`, and *returns* the **greatest** *integer* ≤ `x`, denoted `⌊x⌋` or `floor(x)`.<br>
The **ceiling function**, is the function that takes as *input* a *real number* `x`, and *returns* the **smallest** *integer* ≥ `x`, denoted `⌈x⌉` or `ceil(x)`.<br>

<br>

Examples:
- `⌊2.4⌋ = 2`;
- `⌊−2.4⌋ = −3`;
- `⌈2.4⌉ = 3`;
- `⌈−2.4⌉ = −2`;
