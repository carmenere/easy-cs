# Basic concepts
Basic concepts involved in working with multilingual text: **characters** and their relationships to **keystrokes**, **codepoints** and **glyphs**.

<br>

## Orthography
An **orthography** /ɔːˈθɒɡrəfi/ is a set of conventions for writing a language. In other words, **orthography** is **the system of spelling**.

<br>

A **writing system** is a **method of visually representing verbal communication** based on a **script** and an **orthography**. **Script** is a set of **symbols** (aka **signs**). Most known scripts are **Latin**, **Greek** and **Cyrillic**.<br>

<br>

## Grapheme
A **grapheme** is the smallest **functional unit** of a *writing system*.<br>
**Orthographic units**, such as **letters** of an alphabet, are technically called **graphemes** /ˈɡræfiːmz/.<br>
**Graphemes** are often notated within **angle** brackets e.g `⟨a⟩`.<br>
**Graphemes** are analogous to the **phonemes** /ˈfəʊniːm/ of **spoken languages**. So, **spelling rules** define the relationship between **phonemes** and **graphemes**.<br>
In other words, **spelling** is the rendering of *speech sound* (**phoneme**) into *writing* (**grapheme**).<br>

<br>

## Glyph
A **glyph** is a **particular visual representation** of **an element of written language**:
- a *grapheme*;
- a *part of a grapheme* (aka *diacritic*);

<br>

In other words, a **glyph** as **an element of font**. It is the specific **shape**, **design**, or **representation** of a **grapheme**.<br>

A **grapheme** is **abstract**, for example **the idea of an** `a`, while a **glyph** is **concrete**.<br>

<br>

## Graphemes and Glyphs
In some writing systems **one grapheme** may correspond to **several glyphs**.<br>
In general **grapheme** consists of **one** or **more glyphs**.<br>

Examples:
- `⟨à⟩` is a **grapheme** and it consists of **two** *glyphs*: the **letter** `a` and the **diacritical mark**;
- `⟨ch⟩` is a **grapheme** in Spanish and it consists of **two letters** of Latin script: `c` and `h`;

<br>

Combinations of **two** or **more letters** of an alphabet are called **multigraphs**. So, **grapheme** `⟨ch⟩` is a **multigraph**.<br>
A **multigraph** that consists of **two** letters is called **digraph**. So, **grapheme** `⟨ch⟩` is a **digraph**.<br>

So, **multigraphs** are all **graphemes**.<br>

<br>

### Allographs
**The same grapheme** can be represented by **various glyphs**. For example, there are *two different visual representations* of the lowercase letter `a`: `a` and `ɑ`.<br>
These **different visual representations** are known as **allographs** /ˈaləɡrɑːfs/ of a *grapheme*. For example, **lowercase**, **uppercase**, **italic** or **bold** are different **allographs** of the same letter.

<br>

### Diacritic
A **diacritic** (aka **diacritical mark**, **diacritical sign**) is a **glyph** added to a **letter**.<br>
The main use of diacritics in Latin script is to **change the sound-values** of the letters to which they are added.<br>

Letters with **diacritics**: `á`, `ǎ`, `ä`.<br>
