# Pure functions
Functions are used to break down a code into smaller, more manageable pieces.<br>
**Side effects** are **changes** to external state, for example, _writing to file_, _writing to db_, _modifying global variables_.<br>
Functions that **don't** modify **external state**** and **always** produce the **same output** for the **same input** are called **pure functions**.<br>
In other words, _pure function_ is a **function without side effects**.<br>
