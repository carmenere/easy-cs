# First-class items
**First-class items** (object, type, entity, or value) are items that satisfies the following properties:
- can be **created** or **deleted** *at runtime*;
- can be passed to functions;
- can be returned as results from functions;
- can be assigned to variables.

# Second-class items
Second-class items are items that are **not** *first-class items*.

<br>

# First-class functions
**First-class functions** are **functions** that are **first-class** items. 

**First-class function** means the language supports:
- passing functions as arguments to other functions;
- returning functions as the values from other functions;
- assigning functions to variables.

For instance, functions in `C` are **second-class** functions.

# Higher-order functions
**Higher-order function** is a function that does at least one of the following:
- takes **one** or **more** functions as arguments;
- returns a function as its **result**.

All other functions are **first-order functions**.
