# Intrinsics (/ɪnˈtrɪnzɪks/)
**Compiler intrinsics** (or just **intrinsics**) are **built-in functions** or **types** available for use in a given programming language. **Intrinsics** are implemented internaly inside compiler.<br>

*Intrinsic* functions are often used to implement **vectorization** and **parallelization** /pærəlelaɪˈzeɪʃ(ə)n/ in languages which do not address such constructs. The compiler parses the *intrinsic* functions and converts them into specific **instructions appropriate** for the **target platform**. For example, `gcc` implements *intrinsics* that map directly to the **x86 SIMD instructions**.<br>
