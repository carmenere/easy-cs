# l-value
The concept of **l-value** was originally introduced in `C`. Since the reserved word `const` was added to the `C` language, the concept of **modifiable l-value** was introduced.<br>
**l-value** is a value that **represents address** in RAM, i.e., it is **reference** to an object that located in RAM, it is **locator** value.<br>
**l-values** are often **identifiers** or **pointers**.<br>

<br>

# r-value
**r-value** is **wider** than **l-value**: it is **any** value.

<br>

# Assignment
**l-value** can appear on the **left** of the **assignment operator** (`=`).<br>
**r-value** or **l-value** can appear on the **right** of the **assignment operator** (`=`).<br>
