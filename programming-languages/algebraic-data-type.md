# Algebraic data type
**Algebraic data type** (**ADT**) is a kind of **composite type**, i.e., a type formed by combining other types.<br>

**2 classes** of *algebraic types*: 
- **product types** (aka *tuple*, *record*, *struct*). 
- **sum types** (aka *tagged union*, *enumeration*, *variant*, *disjoint union*).

<br>

## Product type
**Product type** for types `A` and `B` is pair of instances of `A` **and** `B`.<br>
**Product type** for types `A` and `B` is denoted as `A * B`.<br>

<br>

# Sum type
**Sum type** for types `A` and `B` is an instance of `A` **or** an instance of `B`.<br>
**Sum type** for types `A` and `B` is denoted as `A + B`.<br>


<br>

# Function type
**Function type** `A â†’ B` is the function that **receives** object of type `A` and **returns** object of type `B` as result.
