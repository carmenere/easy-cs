# Spelling
**Spelling** is the **arrangement of letters** that form a word.<br>

<br>

# Grammar
## Syntax and morphology
**Syntax** deals with how sentences are constructed.<br>
In some languages **order of words** is significantly important, e.g. in **English**, in such languages what is subject and what is object is determined by position in the sentence. But there are also languages in which **order of words** doesn't matter, e.g. Russian.<br>

Consider examples:
|Russian|English|
|:------|:------|
|**Учительница** читает *книгу*.|**Teacher** reads the *book*.|
|*Книгу* читает **учительница**.|*Book* reads **teacher**.|
|Читает **учительница** *книгу*.|Read **teacher** *book*.|

- the ending **-у** in the end of word *книг***у** indicates that it is the **direct object**;
- the ending **-а** in the end of word *учительниц***а** indicates that it is the **subject**;

<br>

These changes in the form of the words to indicate their function in the sentence are called **inflections**.<br>
**Morphology** /mɔːˈfɒl.ə.dʒi/ studies how words can **change their forms to express grammatical categories** in sentence, i.e. how words are inflected.<br>

<br>

Relationship between **syntax** and **morphology**: something which may be expressed **syntactically** in some languages may be expressed **morphologically** in others.<br>
What is subject and what is object is signalled **syntactically** in the **English**, while it is expressed **morphologically** in the **Russian**.<br>

**Syntax** and **morphology** make up what is traditionally called **grammar**.<br>

<br>

## Syntactic structure of sentence
There are **2 aspects** in the **syntactic structure** of sentence:
1. **Relational structure** (aka grammatical relations): **determines the functions** of elements, e.g. *subject*, *predicate*, *object* and so on.
2. **Constituent structure** determines the **hierarchical organization** /ˌhaɪəˈrɑː.kɪ.kəl/ of the units in the sentence. A sentence is **not** simply a string of words. Instead the words are organized into **units** which are then organized into **larger units**. These **larger units** are called **constituents** /kənˈstɪtʃ.u.ənts/.<br>

<br>

## Morphology
Morphology is often divided into 2 types:
- **derivational morphology**: changes the meaning of words;
- **inflectional morphology**: expresses grammatical properties according to syntactic category;

<br>

## Constituents
A **constituent** is a **word** or **group of words** that **functions as a single unit**.<br>
**Constituents** are organized into **hierarchical structure**.<br>
Because **constituent** behaves like **single unit** it **can be replaced** by **single word** of the **same category**.<br>
**Many constituents** are **phrases**. A **phrase** is a **sequence of one or more words** built around a **head** and working as a **single unit** within a sentence.<br>

<br>

## Head
The **head of phrase** or just **head** is a the word in the phrase that **determines the grammatical properties** of that phrase, i.e. it **determines syntactic category** of phrase.<br>
The **head of compound** word is the **stem**/**root** that **determines the meaning** of that compound word.<br>

Examples:
- the **head of compound** `handbag` is a `bag`, because `handbag` is a kind of `bag`, **not** kind of `hand`;
- the **head of the phrase** `big red dog` is a `dog`, so the phrase is a **noun phrase**, because **head** is a **noun**;

<br>

## Affixes
A **morpheme** is a smallest meaningful unit of language that **can't be subdivided**.<br>
**Morphemes** can be both **whole words** and **partial words**, so morphemes are categorized as **bound** or **free**:
- **free morpheme** is a morpheme that can be used as complete word and also can be attached to another words;
- **bound morpheme** is a morpheme that can only be attached to another word or morpheme to form a complete word;

<br>

An **affix** is a **morpheme** /ˈmɔː.fiːm/ that is **attached** to a **word stem** to form **new word** or **word form**.<br>

<br>

**Types of affixes**:
- **prefixation** is an adding **affix** at the **beginning** of a word, such *affix* is called **prefix**;
- **infixation** is an adding **affix** in the **middle** of a word, such *affix* is called **infix**;
- **postfixation** is an adding **affix** at the **end** of a word, such *affix* is called **suffix**;

<br>

There are **2 categories** of *affixes*:
- **derivational affixes** - they cause to a **semantic change** of the word (*meaning of the word*) they are attached to, e.g. `anti-`, `un-`, `pre-`, etc;
- **inflectional affixes** - they cause to a **syntactic change** of the word (*grammatical properties of word*) they are attached to:
  - *singular* -> *plural* by adding `-s`, e.g. dog -> dog**s**;
  - *present* -> *continuous* by adding `-ing`;

<br>

# Word formation
There are **2 common methods of word formation**:
- **inflection** is a modifying a word for the purpose of **fitting** it into the **grammatical properties**;
- **derivation** is a modifying a word for the purpose of **changing it semantic** and/or **category**;

<br>

## Derivation
### Ways of derivation
1. **Affixation** is an adding **derivational affixes**;
2. **Conversion** is a type of derivation, when a word is morphologically ambiguous between different categories.
   - Examples:
     - **cut** as *verb* -> **cut** as *noun*;
3. **Composition** is a type of derivation that creates **compound lexemes**. **Compound** is a **lexeme** that consists of **more** than one root, in other words, **compounds** are words that contain **multiple roots**.

There are 2 types of compounds:
- **open compounds** - when **stems** are **joined** with **spaces**: **high school**, **school bus**, etc.;
- **closed compounds** - when stems are joined without spaces: **footpath**;
- **hyphenated compounds** - when stems are joined by hyphens: **must-have**;

<br>

### Word stem
**Stem** or **word stem** is a **part of word** that is **responsible** for **lexical meaning** of that word. Typically a **stem** remains **unmodified during inflection**. In other words:
- a **stem** is a **base** from which all its **inflected variants** are **formed**;
- a **stem** is a part of word that is **common** to **all** of its **inflected variants**;

<br>

Consider example: **destabilized**:
- the `stabil` is the **root**;
- the `destabilize` is the **stem**, so the `-ed`/`-d` is **not** part of the *stem*;

<br>

In some cases **stem** and **root** can **coincide**, e.g. **run**.
Also **stem** can be a **closed compound**, e.g. **bottleneck**.

<br>

### Derivational paradigm
A **derivational paradigm** is a **set of all words** that have the **same root** but **different meaning**.<br>

<br>

## Inflection
**Inflection** is the **morphological process** through which words or phrases **change their forms to express grammatical properties** such as:
- **tense**;
- **mood**;
- **voice**;
- **case**;
- **gender**;
- **person**;
- **number**;

<br>

**Inflection** is distinct from **derivation**, while both involve **morphological changes**, *inflection* **focuses on grammatical properties** rather creating new lexemes.<br>
**Inflection doesn't create new lexemes**, instead it **modifies the same lexeme to represent grammatical properties**.<br>
**Derivation** creates **new lexemes**.<br>

<br>

In different languages the **degree of inflection is varying**. For example, *Russian* is **more inflected** than *English*.<br>
Examples of **highly inflected languages**: **Arabic**, **Turkish**, **Russian**.<br>

<br>

### Lexemes. Lemmas. Lexical items
A **lexeme** /lɛksiːm/ is a **unit of lexical meaning**, i.e. it is a **unit of language** that represent a single, distinct meaning.<br>
A **lexeme** is the **abstract form of a word** without writing form that includes **all its inflected forms**.<br>
**Lexemes** are **represented** by writing their **lemmas** in *small capital letters*: `CUT`.<br>

A **lemma** is the **canonical form** of the **lexeme**.<br>
A **lemma** is one form (aka *citation form* or *dictionary form*) chosen by convention and **used in dictionaries** as the **entry to the lexeme** and its inflected forms.<br>

A **lexical item** (aka *lexical unit*, *lexical entry*) refers to **any instance** of a **lexeme**.<br>

The **difference** between *lexemes* and *morphemes* is that **lexemes** are never partial words, they **are always** **complete words**.<br>

With respect to **morphology** *lexemes* can be **simple** and **complex**.<br>
With respect to **semantics** *lexemes* can be **monosemous** /mɒnə(ʊ)ˈsiːməs/ and **polysemous**.<br>

<br>

### Types of lexical items
- words;
- phrasal verbs;
- multiword expressions: by the way, etc.;
- collocations;
- idioms;
- syyings;

<br>

#### Example
Lexeme: **park**.
Syntactic category: **noun**.
Inflectional versions: **parks**, **parks'**, **park's**.
Meaning: the area where people walk and relax and enjoy by nature.

<br>

Lexeme: **park**.
Syntactic category: **verb**.
Inflectional versions: **parks**, **parking**, **parked**.
Meaning: the area where people walk and relax and enjoy by nature.

<br>

Although these 2 words are sound and spelled the same they are **2 distinct lexemes**.<br>

<br>

## Inflectional paradigm
**Lexeme** refers to the **set of all its inflected forms**.<br>
A **lemma** refers to the **particular form** that is chosen by convention to represent that **lexeme**.<br>

A **lexeme** is a **uit of language** which:
- belongs to a **paticular syntactic category**;
- has a **particular meaning**;
- has a corresponding **inflectional paradigm**;

All **inflected forms** of a **lexeme** a called **word forms** or **inflectional paradigm**.<br>

<br>

# Syntactic categories
**Syntactic category** means **group of words** that have **similar grammatical properties**.<br>
**Syntactic category** is used for **grouping** words by their **syntactic** and/or **morphological** behaviour.<br>

<br>

**Syntactic category** includes:
- **lexical category**;
- **functional category**;
- **phrasal category**;

<br>

**Lexical category** is a *syntactic category* of words that **carry primary meaning** in sentences **Lexical category** is also known as **POS** (**P**art **O**f **S**peech) or **word class**.<br>
Examples:
- *noun*
- *verb*
- *adjective*
- *adverb*;

<br>

**Functional category** includes words that **don't** carry primary meaning in sentences, they **connect other parts of sentecne together**.<br>

**Phrasal category** is the same idea as *lexical category* but **for constituents**: *phrases*, *group of words*, *etc*.<br>
Examples:
- *noun phrase*;
- *verb phrase*;
- *prepositional phrase*;
- *adverb phrase*;
- *adjective phrase*;

<br>

Each **syntactic category** has specific **morphological** and **distributional** properties.<br>
For example, **functional categories** often determine **distribution of lexical items in the sentecne**.<br>

There are **2 kinds of properties** we can use to **classify** words into **syntactic categories**:
- **inflectional morphological properties**;
- **distributional properties**, aka **word order**: every element goes in particular position;

Both kind of properties are **language specific**.<br>

<br>

# Transcriptions
**Phonemic transcription** represents **abstract phonemes** (*abstract sounds*) of a language.<br>
**Phonemic transcription** is written inside slashes `/ ... /`.<br>
It uses basic phonemic symbols.<br>

<br>

**Phonetic transcription** describes a **precise sounds**.<br>
**Phonetic transcription** is written inside square brackets `[ ... ]`.<br>
It uses **International Phonetic Alphabet** symbols (**IPA**).<br>
