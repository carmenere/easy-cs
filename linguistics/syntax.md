# Spelling
**Spelling** is the **arrangement of letters** that form a word.<br>

<br>

# Grammar: syntax and morphology
**Syntax** deals with how sentences are constructed.<br>
In some languages **order of words** is significantly important, e.g. in **English**, in such languages what is subject and what is object is determined by position in the sentence. But there are also languages in which **order of words** doesn't matter, e.g. Russian.<br>

Consider examples:
|Russian|English|
|:------|:------|
|**Учительница** читает *книгу*.|**Teacher** reads the *book*.|
|*Книгу* читает **учительница**.|*Book* reads **teacher**.|
|Читает **учительница** *книгу*.|Read **teacher** *book*.|

- the ending **-у** in the end of word *книг***у** indicates that it is the **direct object**;
- the ending **-а** in the end of word *учительниц***а** indicates that it is the **subject**;

<br>

These changes in the form of the words to indicate their function in the sentence are called **inflections**.<br>
**Morphology** /mɔːˈfɒl.ə.dʒi/ studies how words can **change their forms to express grammatical categories** in sentence, i.e. how words are inflected.<br>

<br>

Relationship between **syntax** and **morphology**: something which may be expressed **syntactically** in some languages may be expressed **morphologically** in others.<br>
What is subject and what is object is signalled **syntactically** in the **English**, while it is expressed **morphologically** in the **Russian**.<br>

**Syntax** and **morphology** make up what is traditionally called **grammar**.<br>

<br>

# Syntactic structure of sentence
There are **2 aspects** in the **syntactic structure** of sentence:
1. **Relational structure** (aka grammatical relations): **determines the functions** of elements, e.g. *subject*, *predicate*, *object* and so on.
2. **Constituent structure** determines the **hierarchical organization** /ˌhaɪəˈrɑː.kɪ.kəl/ of the units in the sentence. A sentence is **not** simply a string of words. Instead the words are organized into **units** which are then organized into **larger units**. These **larger units** are called **constituents** /kənˈstɪtʃ.u.ənts/.<br>

<br>

# Morphology
Morphology is often divided into 2 types:
- **derivational morphology**: changes the meaning of words;
- **inflectional morphology**: expresses grammatical information according to syntactic category;

<br>

# Constituents
A **constituent** is a **word** or **group of words** that **functions as a single unit**.<br>
**Constituents** are organized into **hierarchical structure**.<br>
Because **constituent** behaves like **single unit** it **can be replaced** by **single word** of the **same category**.<br>
Many constituents are phrases. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words built around a **head** lexical item and working as a single unit within a sentence.<br>

<br>

# Afixes
A **morpheme** is a smallest meaningful unit of language that **can't be subdivided**.<br>
**Morphemes** can be both **whole words** and **partial words**, so morphemes are categorized as **bound** or **free**:
- **free morpheme** is a morpheme that can be used as complete word and also can be attached to another words;
- **bound morpheme** is a morpheme that can only be attached to another word or morpheme to form a complete word;

<br>

An **affix** is a **morpheme** /ˈmɔː.fiːm/ that is **attached** to a **word stem** to form **new word** or **word form**.<br>

<br>

- **prefixation** is an adding **affix** at the **beginning**;
- **infixation** is an adding **affix** in the **middle**;
- **postfixation** is an adding **affix** at the **end**;

<br>

There are **2 categories** of affixes:
- **derivational affixes** - they cause to a **semantic change** of the word the are atteched to, e.g. `anti-`, `un-`, `pre-`, etc;
- **inflectional affixes** - they cause to a **syntactic change** of the word they are attached to:
  - *singular* -> *plural* by adding `-s`, e.g. dog -> dog**s**;
  - *present* -> *continuous* by adding `-ing`;
