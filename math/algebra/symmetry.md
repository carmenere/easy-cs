# Symmetry
## Reflection Symmetry
**Reflection symmetry** (aka **line symmetry**, **mirror symmetry**) is easy to see, because **one half** is the **reflection** of the **other half**.<br>

For example,
- a **square** can have **4** *lines of symmetry*;
- a **letter** **T** has only **1** *line of symmetry*;
- a **letter** **B** has **no** *lines of symmetry*;

## Point Symmetry
**Point symmetry** occurs when there is a **central point** on an object such that:
- the *central point* **divides** the shape into **two parts** or sides, **Part 1** and **Part 2**
- **every point** on **Part 1** must **have** a **matching point** on **Part 2** the **same distance** from the *central point* but in the **opposite direction**.

It is identical to **rotational symmetry** of order **2**.<br>

## Rotational symmetry
**Rotational symmetry** of **order n** (aka **n-fold rotational symmetry**) means that rotation by an **angle** $`{\displaystyle {\tfrac {360^{\circ }}{n}}}`$ about a particular **point** (in **2D**) or **axis** (in **3D**) does **not** change the object.<br>

A **1-fold** symmetry is **no symmetry** (all objects look alike after a rotation of 360Â°).<br>

An example of **3-fold** symmetry:<br>
