# Symmetry

## Reflection Symmetry
**Reflection symmetry** (aka **line symmetry**, **mirror symmetry**) is easy to see, because **one half** is the **reflection** of the **other half**.<br>

For example,
- a **square** can have **4** *lines of symmetry*;
- a letter **T** has only **1** *line of symmetry*;
- a letter **B** has **no** *lines of symmetry*;

## Point Symmetry
**Point symmetry** occurs when there is a **central point** on an object such that:
- the *central point* **divides** the shape into **two parts** or sides, **Part 1** and **Part 2**
- **every point** on **Part 1** must **have** a **matching point** on **Part 2** the **same distance** from the *central point* but in the **opposite direction**.

It is identical to **rotational symmetry** of order **2**.<br>

## Rotational Symmetry
**Rotational symmetry** of **order n** (aka **n-fold rotational symmetry**) means that rotation by an **angle** $`{\displaystyle {\tfrac {360^{\circ }}{n}}}`$ about a particular **point** (in 2D) or **axis** (in 3D) does **not** change the object.<br>

The notation for **n-fold symmetry** is $`C_{n}`$.<br>

A **1-fold** symmetry is **no symmetry** (all objects look alike after a rotation of 360°).<br>

$`C_{n}`$ is the rotation group of a **regular polygon** with $`n`$ sides in 2D

**Cyclic group** $`C_{n}`$ (of order $`n`$) is the **group of rotations** of a **regular polygon** with $`n`$ sides, where $`C_{n}`$ includes **all rotations** about a *particular cenral point* by an **angle** of $`360°/n`$<br>

**Dihedral group** $`D_{n}`$ (of order $`2n`$) is the **group of symmetries** of a **regular polygon** with $`n`$ sides, where $`D_{n}`$ includes **all rotations** from $`C_{n}`$ group and also **reflections** in $`n`$ **axes** that pass through the *particular cenral point*.<br>
