# Serialization and Deserialization
**Serialization** (aka **marshalling**) is the process of translating the data structure into a format that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed later, possibly in a different environment.

**Deserialization** (aka **unmarshalling**) is the process of **reconstructing** the **semantically identical clone** of the original data structure from serialized representation.

**Deserialization** is the opposite to **Serialization**.
